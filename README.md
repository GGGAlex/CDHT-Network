# Circular Distributed Hash Table Network 
# 
# A simple distributed network design which maintains system stability through a circular network of nodes and peers.
# System is able to handle loss and addition of new peers to the network whilst maintaining a distributed hashable filename system. Filenames are automatically divided amongst the available peers. 
# Users can search for hashed filenames using a simple query and the system will return the location (holding peer) of the filename.
